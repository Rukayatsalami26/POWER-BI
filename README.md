# Resturant Rating POWER-BI

## INTRODUCTION
This is a power Bi project called the restaurant rating dataset which contains information about restaurants in mexico . This project was carried out in mexico in 2012 to collocate information about each restuarants. I created an insight to answer questions given.

## SKILLS DEMOSTRATED
The following Power Bi features were used
•	New measure, 
•	filtering 
•	data cleaning
•	data modelling

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
•	What can you learn from the highest rated restaurants? Do consumer preferences have an effect on
•	ratings?
•	What are the consumer demographics? Does this indicate a bias in the data sample?
•	Are there any demand & supply gaps that you can exploit in the market?
•	If you were to invest in a restaurant, which characteristics would you be looking for?

## VISUALIZATION
The report consist of;
•	Resturants rating
•	Customer preference

## FEATURES
 Dashboard  features  include;
•	3(Donut) CHART
•	2 pie chart
•	5 column chart
•	1 clustered chart

## ANALYSIS

•	The first page illustrate sum of overall rating by name, food preferred cuisine and service rating etc
•	The second page also illustrate the count of consumer id by occupation, transportation, preffered cuisine and marital status etc.

## RECOMMENDATION & CONCLUSION
What I can recommend for a restaurant facing low sales is to 
•	restrategize their marketing plan
•	Change of location if possible
•	Good customer approach
•	Advertisement
Inconclusion, the consumer preferences did not have an effect on the ratings and also there are demand and supply gaps that can be exploit in the market because the consumers were not served what they wanted
